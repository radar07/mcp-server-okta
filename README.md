**Empower your LLM Agents to Manage your Okta Organization**

`mcp-server-okta` is a powerful integration that bridges the gap between your Large Language Model (LLM) agents and the Okta Admin Management APIs. This project enables users to leverage the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs to interact with and manage their Okta organization in a more intuitive and automated way.

## Key Features

* **LLM-Driven Okta Management:** Allows your LLM agents to perform administrative tasks within your Okta environment based on natural language instructions.
* **Integration with Okta Admin Management APIs:** Leverages the official Okta APIs to ensure secure and reliable interaction with your Okta org.
* **Extensible Architecture:** Designed to be easily extended with new functionalities and support for additional Okta API endpoints.
* **Potential Use Cases:**
    * Automating user provisioning and de-provisioning.
    * Managing group memberships.
    * Retrieving user information.
    * Generating reports on Okta activity.
    * And much more, driven by the capabilities of your LLM agents.
 
This MCP server utilizes [Okta's OpenSource Go SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-golang) to communicate with the OKTA APIs, ensuring a robust and well-supported integration.

 
## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from the innovative work done in the following projects:

* **[github/github-mcp-server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server):** This project demonstrated the power of creating a Machine Control Plane (MCP) server to enable programmatic interaction with GitHub's features. `mcp-server-okta` aims to bring a similar level of programmatic control to Okta through LLM agents.
* **[razorpay/razorpay-mcp-server](https://github.com/razorpay/razorpay-mcp-server):** Razorpay's MCP server further illustrated the benefits of a centralized control plane for managing infrastructure and services. This project reinforced the idea of building a dedicated server to facilitate interactions between LLMs and specific platforms like Okta.

`mcp-server-okta` builds upon these concepts to provide a tailored solution for managing Okta using the intelligence and flexibility of LLM agents.

## Getting Started

While this README provides a high-level overview, specific setup and usage instructions will depend on your LLM agent framework and your Okta environment. Generally, you will need to:

1.  **Obtain Okta API Credentials:** You will need to create an API token within your Okta organization with the necessary permissions to perform the actions you intend to automate with your LLM agents. Refer to the [Okta Developer documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api-overview/#authentication) for details on how to create API tokens.
2.  **Configure `mcp-server-okta`:** This project likely requires some configuration to connect to your Okta instance. This might involve setting environment variables or configuring a configuration file with your Okta domain and API token.
3.  **Integrate with your LLM Agent Framework:** You will need to implement the logic within your LLM agent framework to interact with the `mcp-server-okta` server. This might involve sending API requests to specific endpoints exposed by this project based on the user's natural language input.

**Detailed setup and usage instructions will be provided in further documentation.**

## Prerequisites

* An active Okta organization with administrative privileges.
* Familiarity with Okta Admin Management APIs.
* An existing LLM agent framework that you wish to integrate with.

## Installation
